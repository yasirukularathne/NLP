What’s Inside the Pipeline?
The pipeline() function encapsulates the following components and steps:

Tokenizer:
Converts raw text (e.g., "I love this!") into a format the model can understand (tokens, then numerical IDs).
For example, it might tokenize "I love this!" into ["I", "love", "this", "!"] and map them to IDs based on the model’s vocabulary.
Pre-trained Model:
Loads a neural network model trained on a large dataset for sentiment analysis (e.g., distinguishing positive vs. negative sentiment).
By default, pipeline("sentiment-analysis") uses a model like distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english (unless you specify another).
Preprocessing:
Handles tasks like padding, truncation, and converting text into the input format required by the model (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow tensors).
Inference:
Runs the input through the model to get predictions (e.g., logits or probabilities for sentiment classes like "positive" or "negative").
Postprocessing:
Converts the model’s raw output (e.g., probabilities) into human-readable results, such as a label (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE) and a confidence score.
